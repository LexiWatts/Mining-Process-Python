This project was done to analyze the Quality Prediction in the Mining process. 

Data set was taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edumagalhaes/quality-prediction-in-a-mining-process

"The main goal is to use this data to predict how much impurity is in the ore concentrate. 
As this impurity is measured every hour, if we can predict how much silica (impurity) is in the ore concentrate, we can help the engineers, giving them early information to take actions (empowering!). 
Hence, they will be able to take corrective actions in advance (reduce impurity, if it is the case) and also help the environment (reducing the amount of ore that goes to tailings as you reduce silica in the ore concentrate)." - Kaggle
